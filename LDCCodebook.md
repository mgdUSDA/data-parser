# Lachat Drift Correction Codebook

The R script reads a user selected raw data file (.csv) generated by Onmion version 3.0.  The raw data file will contain data for 1 to 3 of the following compounds:  NH3, NO3 or PO4. 

[1] "Sample.ID" "Replicate.Number" "Cup.Number"  "Detection.Date"  "Detection.Time"       
[6] "Auto.Dilution.Factor"  "Analyte.Name"  "Peak.Area"   "Peak.Height" "Peak.Concentration"   
[11] "Concentration.Units"   "Channel.Number" 

Analyte.Name, Peak.Area, Peak.Height, Peak.Concentration, Concentration.Units, and Channel.Number are repeated for each compound and will have a .1 or .2 appended accordingly.

The script renames the columns to include the analyte name and removes the "." from all the names.  It then reformats the data into tidy form so that it only contains 6 analyte related variables:  Area, Height, Concentration, Units, Channel and Analyte.  Finally it exports 3 data files.  Each file has the name of the original data file plus a suffix to identify the content of the file:

_tidy :  A tidy data file.
  
_messy :  A messy data file that saves the data in the original layout but with renamed columns discussed above.
 
_LDC :  A drift corrected data file.
   
###   Drift correction is not yet implemented, so the _LDC file is a copy of the tidy data file.

(Now that it has been edited in R I will push to gitHub)
